# Algorithm Visualizer 

## Description 
Sorting  problems are  really common in coding interviews. This project was built as a visual aid to learn  about them and consolide their knowledge. Since there is a lot of sorting algorithms, only a few of them made it here. Those are: merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort and heap sort.

***This app was built entirely with React***

## Challenges 
Implementation of the algorithms in a way that the data could be translated to an animation.  
***For heap sort***, the base for the implementation can be found [here](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort)  
***For merge sort***,  you can find it [here](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial/blob/master/src/sortingAlgorithms/sortingAlgorithms.js)


## Future Ideas 
One can continue implementing  more sorting algorithms like insertion sort, selection sort, etc.  
Another fun idea would be to implement a input tag where you can choose the length of the array to sort and max and min values. 

## Steps for installing and running the project 
1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
